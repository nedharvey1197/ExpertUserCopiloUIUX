EnrichedTrialConnector (copilot/data/aact_enriched_connector.py)

This connector provides access to enriched clinical trial metadata stored in the
`copilot.trial_summary_mat` materialized view, which aggregates key fields from the
AACT database into a unified structure aligned with the Copilot's 5Ws and trial design schema.

Core Features:
--------------
- Safely queries trials by NCT ID or condition keyword (via ILIKE match)
- Supports optional filtering by validated AACT-enumerated fields (e.g., gender)
- Uses centralized input normalization via `enums_filter.py` to enforce schema-aligned values
- Returns structured trial records as dictionaries for downstream enrichment, summarization, or frontend use

Filter Safety:
--------------
All filters (e.g., gender, phase) are normalized and validated using the `normalize_filter()` utility.
This ensures resilience against user typos, schema drift, and invalid input.

Expected Use:
-------------
This class is designed to be called from Copilot session flows, background enrichment steps,
or REST API endpoints to return clinical trial metadata in a structured and consistent format.

Example Usage:
--------------
    from aact_enriched_connector import EnrichedTrialConnector

    connector = EnrichedTrialConnector()
    trial = connector.get_trial_by_nct("NCT01234567")
    results = connector.search_trials_by_condition("glioblastoma", gender="female")
