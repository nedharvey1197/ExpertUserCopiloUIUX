I can see the issue in your `App.jsx` file. There's a floating `useEffect` hook that's not properly connected to any component. It appears to be a fragment of code that was accidentally placed outside of the component definition.

Let me fix this by removing the floating code since it's already properly implemented inside the `App` component:

```diff
  } from "./components/ui/tabs";
  import { MessageCircle, ClipboardList } from "lucide-react";
- 
-   setCopilotSummary(lines.join("\n"));
- }, [who, what, why, where, when]);
  
  export default function App() {
    const [why, setWhy] = useState("");
    const [copilotSummary, setCopilotSummary] = useState("");
- 
-   useEffect(() => {
-     const lines = [];
- 
-     if (who) lines.push(`👥 WHO: ${who}`);
-     if (what) lines.push(`💊 WHAT: ${what}`);
-     if (why) lines.push(`🧠 WHY: ${why}`);
-     if (!who || !what || !why) {
-       lines.push("🔍 Copilot is still waiting for more info to understand the full trial picture.");
-     } else {
-       lines.push("✅ You’re building a strong foundation. Let me know when you’re ready to explore endpoints or comparators.");
-     }
- 
-     setCopilotSummary(lines.join("\n"));
-   }, [who, what, why, where, when]);
-   
+ 
    const allBasicsFilled = companyName && website && therapeuticArea && phase;
  
          />
          <Textarea
-           placeholder="🧠 WHY: What’s the clinical/scientific rationale behind this trial?"
+           placeholder="🧠 WHY: What's the clinical/scientific rationale behind this trial?"
            value={why}
            onChange={(e) => setWhy(e.target.value)}
```

I notice that the apply model accidentally removed the `useEffect` hook from inside the component as well. Let me add it back since it's an important part of the functionality:


---

_****_

```diff
    const [why, setWhy] = useState("");
    const [copilotSummary, setCopilotSummary] = useState("");
+ 
+   useEffect(() => {
+     const lines = [];
+ 
+     if (who) lines.push(`👥 WHO: ${who}`);
+     if (what) lines.push(`💊 WHAT: ${what}`);
+     if (why) lines.push(`🧠 WHY: ${why}`);
+     if (!who || !what || !why) {
+       lines.push("🔍 Copilot is still waiting for more info to understand the full trial picture.");
+     } else {
+       lines.push("✅ You're building a strong foundation. Let me know when you're ready to explore endpoints or comparators.");
+     }
+ 
+     setCopilotSummary(lines.join("\n"));
+   }, [who, what, why, where, when]);
  
    const allBasicsFilled = companyName && website && therapeuticArea && phase;
```

The error should now be fixed. The issue was that there was a floating `useEffect` hook outside of the component definition, which is invalid React syntax. I've:

1. Removed the floating `useEffect` hook that was causing the syntax error
2. Added back the proper `useEffect` hook inside the `App` component where it belongs

The code should now work as intended, updating the copilot summary whenever the `who`, `what`, `why`, `where`, or `when` values change. Let me know if you're still seeing any issues!
